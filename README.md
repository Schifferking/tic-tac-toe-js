# tic-tac-toe-js

This is the Javascript adaptation of tic-tac-toe. It's the same as the Ruby version, the difference is the language used and certain details in the implementation like letting the players put their names and a button to start or restart a game. A bonus of this project is to make a computer AI to play with instead of another player.

## To-do
- Add an AI to play with instead of another player
- Refactor Javascript code
